You have downloaded the wiimote perl module.  I have made a perl interface to Joel Andersson's C library  ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/libwiimote/ ) .  

First read Joel's README.  Follow his instructions and get his libcwiimote working.  Be sure to make sure his test applications work.

Next go into the perlmodules directory.  Just run
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

To test, open up test.pl.  You will need to change line:
print "Connect " . $wii->wiimote_connect('00:19:1D:75:CC:30');

Just put in the id of your wiimote.  The run ./test.pl and with luck it will work.

This is a very rough module.  It is very quick and dirty, but lets perl have access to most functions of the wiimote.
