You have downloaded the wiimote perl module.  I have made a perl interface to Joel Andersson's C library  ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/libwiimote/ ) .  

Make sure that libcwiimote is installed and working before you try this perl module

To install:
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

To test, open up test.pl.  You will need to change line:
print "Connect " . Wiimote::wiimote_connect('00:19:1D:75:CC:30');

Just put in the id of your wiimote.  The run ./test.pl and with luck it will work.

This is a very rough module.  It is very quick and dirty, but lets perl have access to most functions of the wiimote.

Changelog:
Feb 11 2007:
Added libcwiimote header files to the tarball.  
Know bugs: rumble, tilt and axis are broken with the latest release of libcwiimote.  The C library is fine, I just need to update my perl code.
